# Words API

This is an example of a clean api/microservice with express + typescript.

## Setup

1. clone repository
2. run 'npm install'
3. run 'npm run start:dev' to start the server in watch mode locally

npm start and npm build are used for deployment (but you can use it locally also).
If you wish to use it locally, you need firstly to run 'npm run build' and then you can run 'npm start'.

Each time you make a change on your server you will need to rerun these commands, that is why it is
more recommended to use 'npm run start:dev'.
